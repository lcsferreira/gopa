# GoPA Workflow
This is a project in PHP and JS with jQuery for the Global observatory of Physical Activity
The main purpose is to make easier to people provide information about the P.A indicators oftheir countries.
Administrators can check the information and make the new Cards with this informations and statistics.

The project was coded trying to componentize the pages, because i have more experience with React and Angular.
PHP went well with components beside it don't maintain the SPA principle.

It might have some bugs and a not too beautiful coding because i never coded in PHP, so i don't know how the projects are organized. I tried my best on it and it works

I had to develop the database in SQL too, but that was made with the phpMyAdmin interface, so i can't show the code.

For the future work, i'm planning to develop it in React, with the back-end in Node, but i need to work my skills on it.
